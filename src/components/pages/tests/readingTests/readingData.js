    passage: "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest scales. Unlike classical physics, it introduces the concept of wave-particle duality, where particles such as electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This principle was demonstrated in the famous double-slit experiment, which revealed that observation itself can influence the behavior of quantum particles.",
